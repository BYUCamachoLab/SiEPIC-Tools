The following is a list of dependencies needed to run the circuit simulator addition of the toolbox.
Also note that we have been developing this addition in a linux environment (Ubuntu 16 and 18).

Dependencies:
Klayout
Scipy
Matplotlib

Tensor Flow
Keras
h5py
Scikit-rf
graphviz
python3-tk
Pillow

All of these can be installed by running a bash script included in the toolbox. 
Navigate to "~/SiEPIC-Tools/klayout_dot_config/python/SiEPIC/ann" on your computer and run "bash install.sh" from the terminal.
